DroidShield
===========

A framework that enables you to use your android phone as a shield for hardware platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black and more.

The framework contains the android app, and hardware specific libraries. The communitcation happens over serial-bluetooth or serial-usb. 

##Motivation
I started working on this framework because I was tired of not having the right sensors and actuators to prototype my project. Simple stuff like sending SMS or getting the geo-location required costly hardware add-ons. At the same time our mobiles are loaded with sensors and actuators - such as accelerometers, touch display, flash light, camera, proximity sensor, GPS, GSM capabilities (calling, text), 3G net connection, etc. just to name a few.

So I started asking myself what would be the easiest way to leverage the plethora of hardware utilities available on my mobile for my projects? What is the best way to seamlessly integrate them into my prototype? DroidShield was the result.
